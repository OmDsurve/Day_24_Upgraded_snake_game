# Day_24_Upgraded_snake_game
I upgraded a classic Snake game using Python's Turtle module. The game now tracks the highest score, and instead of ending on collision, it resets and continues, making it more engaging. It features smooth movement, randomized food spawning, and responsive controls. Perfect for practicing game development fundamentals!
